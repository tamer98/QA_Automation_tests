# Automation tests using selenium 

## `Description`
The assigned task involves testing the demo version of an employee management system hostedat https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=cms/demo. Testers can choose between frontend or backend testing. The testing process mandates the creation of a minimum of two test cases, including a sanity check and one comprehensive test. The goal is to craft tests that are both engaging and exhaustive, encompassing a broad spectrum of operational activities. If desired, collaboration in groups of three is possible.

## `Main Parameters for the Tests and Methods`
The primary parameters for testing revolve around user authentication, access control mechanisms, role-specific interface components, data manipulation capabilities, and the system's response to varying permission levels. Furthermore, the test plan includes the development of "end-to-end" tests to ensure seamless interactions among different user roles within the system. The used methods encompass the utilization of a Page Object Model (POM) approach, which entails creating distinct classes for each page and test basis.
